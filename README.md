* Expressjs

## Web/Frontend
*Language:* JavaScript

*Toolchain:*

## Development workflow
Vagrant

## Deployment workflow
Docker

**I am still in the phase of figuring things out with Docker. **

## Continous integration
* Travis CI
* Jenkins

**For open-source projects, I always use Travis CI  **

## Hosting platform
* DigitalOcean
* Heroku
* Github Pages

**When I need a complete server where I may need to tinker around or have complete control, I go for DigitalOcean.  When I have something small or a prototype, I might use Heroku instead as it's super simple for deployments. For static sites, I typically use Github pages, especially when the repository is already on Github. I want to take a look at surge.sh, but haven't had a chance to do so yet. **
